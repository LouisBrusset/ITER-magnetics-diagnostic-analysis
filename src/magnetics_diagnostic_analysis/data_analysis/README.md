## Goals

1. First, we have an unlabelled dataset. So our very first goal is to label this dataset.

## Files and fuctionalities

- `metadata_analysis.ipynb` finds the shots for the M9 campaign, finds the labels for the whole shots and finds the labels for each diagnostic thanks to outlier detection with autoencoders.

- `outlier_detection.py` gather all the functions and classes that label the diagnostics.
